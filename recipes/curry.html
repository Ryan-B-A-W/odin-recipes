                <h2>Butter Chicken History</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Butter chicken, traditionally known as murgh makhani, is an Indian dish originating in New Delhi. It is a type of curry made from chicken with a spiced tomato and butter sauce. Its sauce is known for its rich texture. It is similar to chicken tikka masala, which uses a tomato paste.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The curry was developed in New Delhi in the 1950s after the Partition of India by Kundan Lal Jaggi and Kundan Lal Gujral, who were both Punjabi Hindu migrants from Peshawar, as well as the founders of the Moti Mahal restaurant in the Daryaganj neighbourhood of Old Delhi. The curry was made "by chance" by mixing leftover tandoori chicken in a tomato gravy, rich in butter (makhan).</p>
                <br>
                <p>n 1974, a recipe was published for "Murgh makhanii (Tandoori chicken cooked in butter and tomato sauce)". In 1975, the English phrase "butter chicken" curry first appeared in print, as a specialty of the house at Gaylord Indian restaurant in Manhattan.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In Toronto and the Caribbean, it can be found as a filling in pizza, poutine, wraps, roti, or rolls, while in Australia, and New Zealand, it is also eaten as a pie filling. The curry is common in India, Pakistan, and many other countries where a South Asian diaspora is present.</p>

                <h3>STEP 1</h3>
                <p>Bring the chicken and the rest of the marinade ingredients together in a large bowl. Using your hands, massage the marinade into the chicken.
                <br>
                Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to overnight.</p>

                <h3>STEP 2</h3>
                <p>Soak cashews and almonds in water for at least an hour to (or up to overnight) before preparing the rest of the recipe.</p>

                <h3>STEP 3</h3>
                <p>Heat a skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Drizzle a teaspoon of oil to the pan</p>

                <h3>STEP 4</h3>
                <p>Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium sized Dutch oven or a skillet on medium low heat. As soon as the butter melts, add the ginger garlic paste followed by sugar. Saut√© for 1 to 2 minutes.</p>

                <h3>STEP 5</h3>
                <p>Transfer the paste to a blender or the bowl of a food processor. Add the soaked cashews and almonds. Blend into a smooth paste.</p>

                <h3>STEP 6</h3>
                <p>Return the paste to the cooking pan over medium heat. Add the water to the paste and stir to make a smooth sauce.
                <br>
                As the sauce begins to boil, add the grilled chicken and heavy cream. Stir well. Cover the pan and simmer for 5 minutes.</p>

                <h3>STEP 7</h3>
                <p>Turn off the heat and uncover the pan. Stir in the remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter and the kasuri methi. Cover again, and let the dish rest for 8 to 10 minutes so the flavor of kasuri methi can marry into the butter chicken.</p>

                <h3>STEP 8</h3>
                <p>Serve the butter with a side of steamed basmati rice, roti, or naan. Leftovers will keep refrigerated, covered, for five days.
                <br>
                You can freeze this dish in an airtight covered container or a zip-top bag for a month. Thaw and reheat in a saucepan over medium-low heat to retain the texture.</p>
